# My Awesome Telegram Bot
# telegramToChatGP3





To get started, simply send a message to the bot and it will reply with the same message. The bot can be further customized and expanded by adding new command and message handlers.

This project is built as a part of a learning exercise and is open source.





## This is a simple Telegram bot built using the Telegram Bot API and the python-telegram-bot library. The bot is connected to ChatGPT, a large language model trained by OpenAI, and is capable of echoing back messages sent to it, except for commands.
### Getting Started
To use the bot, you will need to create a Telegram bot and obtain an API token. You can do this by talking to the BotFather on Telegram.

Once you have an API token, you can run the bot locally by installing the necessary dependencies and running the main.py file:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
Features
The bot currently supports the following commands:

/start - starts the bot and displays a welcome message
/help - displays a help message with a list of available commands
/echo <message> - echoes the provided message back to the user
